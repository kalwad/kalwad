### 🌱 [Ecological Resource Aggregator](https://github.com/kalwad/ecologoical-resource-aggregator)
A **climate research retrieval tool** powered by knowledge graphs and LLM query rewriting.

- ⚡ Retrieves ecological papers from the CORE API
- 🔁 Rewrites queries for improved semantic match using transformers
- 🧠 Constructs Neo4j knowledge graphs for fast, relevant lookup
- 🧰 Uses PyTorch, Neo4j, NetworkX, rouge-score

### 🧩 [TraceDS for LeetCode – Chrome Extension](https://github.com/kalwad/TraceDS-Chrome-Extension)
Integrates TraceDS directly into **LeetCode** for instant visualization.

- Adds “Visualize in TraceDS” button next to “Run Code”
- Flattens Python `class Solution` into executable function
- Injects sample test cases automatically (when possible)
